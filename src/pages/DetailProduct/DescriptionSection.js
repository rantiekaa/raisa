            NK1 performance running socks - designed for you and your daily
            training shoe.

          <p className="mt-4 text-xl">
            Because, unfortunately, we can't run races every day, we designed
            a line of performance running socks made for the understated shoes
            in your rotation. The ones that you rack up the daily miles in
            during training for your next big race. They might not have carbon
            plates and rods running through them, but you still need a sock
            that will support you, and your shoe, from now until the start
            line.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-xl">
            SHYU 'training' socks are light and breathable like their race day
            counterparts, but boast increased cushioning and greater support
            to keep your feet protected on those daily training runs.
          </p>
